# Tweet-Profanity

The AffinityAnswers.py file contains a code which would calculate the profanity in a tweet.
The tweets are assumed to be in a .csv file under the column name "tweets" and the racial slurs using which the profanity is calculated are assumed to be in a .txt file where every word is in a seperate line. 
The calculated profanity is added to the DataFrame with column name "profanity".
